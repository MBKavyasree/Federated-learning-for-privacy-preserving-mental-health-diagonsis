Federated Learning for Mental Health Prediction

This repository presents a professional implementation of a federated learning (FL) framework designed to predict mental health treatment-seeking behavior, utilizing a survey dataset partitioned by country. The solution addresses challenges posed by non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, ensures privacy through differential privacy mechanisms, and accounts for client dropout (20%) using the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm, logistic regression, and SMOTE for class imbalance correction. SHAP analysis is employed to identify critical features such as age and family history, with visualizations including Sankey diagrams and 3D surface plots to enhance interpretability and insight.
