Federated Learning for Mental Health Prediction
This repository contains the implementation of a federated learning (FL) framework designed to predict mental health treatment-seeking behavior using a survey dataset partitioned by country. The project addresses challenges such as non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data, privacy preservation, and client dropout, making it suitable for real-world healthcare applications.
